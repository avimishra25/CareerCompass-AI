## 📌 Overview

CareerCompass AI is an AI-powered career intelligence platform that analyzes resumes and guides users toward their ideal career path.

It combines NLP (spaCy + TF-IDF) with AI (OpenAI) to not only extract skills and match roles, but also evaluate resumes using ATS-style scoring, identify improvement areas, and provide personalized career guidance through an interactive chatbot.

The platform goes beyond analysis — it helps users understand *what to improve and how to improve it*.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios |
| State Management | React AuthContext (global session) |
| Backend | Node.js, Express.js |
| File Handling | Multer (PDF uploads) |
| Authentication | JWT, bcryptjs |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas, Mongoose |
| AI / NLP | Python, Flask, spaCy, TF-IDF, OpenAI API, pdfminer.six |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

CareerCompass AI follows a multi-service architecture:

- React (Frontend UI)
- Node.js + Express (API + Auth Layer)
- Python Flask (NLP + AI Processing)
- OpenAI API (Intelligent feedback & chatbot)

This separation ensures scalability and modular development.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture & Deployment

CareerCompass AI has evolved into a distributed multi-service architecture to ensure high availability and specialized processing:
- Frontend (Vercel): A high-performance React application optimized for global delivery.
- Core Backend (Render): A Node.js/Express orchestration layer handling authentication, history management, and service coordination.
- NLP Engine (Hugging Face Spaces): A dedicated Python/Flask microservice running spaCy and TF-IDF pipelines for heavy-duty text processing.
- Database (MongoDB Atlas): Cloud-native document storage for user profiles and analysis history.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Uploads Resume (PDF)
        ↓
Express Backend receives file (JWT protected)
        ↓
Resume sent to Python Flask NLP Service
        ↓
spaCy extracts skills + preprocessing
        ↓
TF-IDF ranks and filters important skills
        ↓
Backend performs:
    → Career role matching
    → Skill gap analysis
    → ATS scoring
        ↓
OpenAI analyzes resume:
    → Provides improvement suggestions
    → Generates personalized feedback
        ↓
User can interact via AI chatbot for guidance
        ↓
Results stored in MongoDB
        ↓
Displayed in React dashboard
```

⚙️ Production Environment Setup
To run this in your own production environment, ensure the following environment variables are set across your services:

Vercel (Frontend)
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend-on-render.com
```
Render (Backend)
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
ML_SERVICE_URL=https://your-space-name.hf.space/analyze
```
Hugging Face (ML Service)
Set these in the "Settings > Variables and Secrets" tab of your Space:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works fine)

---

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviam25/CareerCompass-AI.git
cd CareerCompass-AI
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/careercompass?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
PORT=5000
```

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected
Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### 4. Python NLP Service Setup

> ⚠️ This service handles both NLP processing and OpenAI-powered resume analysis & chatbot responses.

```bash
cd ml-service
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install flask spacy pdfminer.six python-dotenv openai
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

NLP service runs at `http://localhost:8000`
```

Create a `.env` file inside `/ml-service`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Run the Service
```
python app.py
```

---

### Running All Three Services

| Terminal | Command | Port |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — NLP | `python app.py` (inside ml-service with venv active) | 8000 |
| 2 — Backend | `node server.js` (inside server/) | 5000 |
| 3 — Frontend | `npm start` (inside client/) | 3000 |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with name, email and password
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storing in MongoDB
3. JWT token is issued and stored in `localStorage`
4. All protected routes (resume upload, history) require a valid `Bearer` token
5. Token is verified server-side on every protected request
6. AuthContext manages global session state across the React app

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- JWT Authentication (Register / Login / Logout)
- Resume PDF upload system
- NLP-based skill extraction (spaCy)
- TF-IDF skill ranking
