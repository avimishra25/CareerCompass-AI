## 📌 Overview

CareerCompass AI is a full-stack web application that helps users understand their career alignment by analyzing their resumes using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It extracts skills from uploaded PDF resumes, evaluates compatibility with different job roles, identifies skill gaps, and recommends the most suitable career path — all behind a secure JWT-authenticated interface with a modern glassmorphism UI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **JWT Authentication** — Secure register/login with bcrypt password hashing
- 📄 **Drag & Drop Resume Upload** — PDF support via Multer with live visual feedback
- 🤖 **NLP Skill Extraction** — Python + spaCy based skill detection
- 🎯 **Job Role Matching** — Algorithm matches extracted skills to predefined career roles
- 📊 **Match Percentage** — Score calculated for each career path with visual progress bars
- ⚠️ **Skill Gap Analysis** — Identifies missing skills per role
- ⭐ **Best Role Recommendation** — Highlights the top matching career
- 🕓 **Analysis History** — Save, view and delete past resume analyses
- 🎨 **Glassmorphism UI** — Soft frosted-glass design system (Linear/Vercel inspired)
- ☁️ **Cloud Database** — MongoDB Atlas for persistent user and analysis storage

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Uploads Resume (PDF)
        ↓
Express Backend receives file (protected route — JWT required)
        ↓
Forwarded to Python Flask NLP Service
        ↓
spaCy extracts skills from resume text
        ↓
Backend matches skills against job role definitions
        ↓
Match scores + missing skills calculated
        ↓
Analysis saved to MongoDB under user account
        ↓
Best career role recommended
        ↓
Results displayed in React dashboard
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works fine)

---

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviam25/CareerCompass-AI.git
cd CareerCompass-AI
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/careercompass?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
PORT=5000
```

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected
Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### 4. Python NLP Service Setup

```bash
cd ml-service
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install flask spacy pdfminer.six
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python app.py
```

NLP service runs at `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Running All Three Services

| Terminal | Command | Port |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — NLP | `python app.py` (inside ml-service with venv active) | 8000 |
| 2 — Backend | `node server.js` (inside server/) | 5000 |
| 3 — Frontend | `npm start` (inside client/) | 3000 |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with name, email and password
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storing in MongoDB
3. JWT token is issued and stored in `localStorage`
4. All protected routes (resume upload, history) require a valid `Bearer` token
5. Token is verified server-side on every protected request
6. AuthContext manages global session state across the React app

---

## 🚀 Current Status
