## 📌 Overview

CareerCompass AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes resumes to help users discover their ideal career path. Using NLP techniques like spaCy-based skill extraction and TF-IDF scoring, it identifies key skills, matches them with relevant job roles, highlights skill gaps, and provides personalized career recommendations — all within a secure, modern full-stack platform.

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Uploads Resume (PDF)
        ↓
Express Backend receives file (protected route — JWT required)
        ↓
Forwarded to Python Flask NLP Service
        ↓
spaCy extracts skills from resume text
        ↓
Backend matches skills against job role definitions
        ↓
Match scores + missing skills calculated
        ↓
Analysis saved to MongoDB under user account
        ↓
Best career role recommended
        ↓
Results displayed in React dashboard
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier works fine)

---

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aviam25/CareerCompass-AI.git
cd CareerCompass-AI
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file inside `/server`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/careercompass?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key_here
PORT=5000
```

Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

You should see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected
Server running on http://localhost:5000
```

---

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

App runs at `http://localhost:3000`

---

### 4. Python NLP Service Setup

```bash
cd ml-service
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate

pip install flask spacy pdfminer.six
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python app.py
```

NLP service runs at `http://localhost:8000`

---

### Running All Three Services

| Terminal | Command | Port |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — NLP | `python app.py` (inside ml-service with venv active) | 8000 |
| 2 — Backend | `node server.js` (inside server/) | 5000 |
| 3 — Frontend | `npm start` (inside client/) | 3000 |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers with name, email and password
2. Password is hashed with bcrypt before storing in MongoDB
3. JWT token is issued and stored in `localStorage`
4. All protected routes (resume upload, history) require a valid `Bearer` token
5. Token is verified server-side on every protected request
6. AuthContext manages global session state across the React app

---

## 🚀 Current Status
